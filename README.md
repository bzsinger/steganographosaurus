# steganographosaurus
Hides a message in the least significant bits of a png image

| Algorithm             | File Format |
|:---------------------:|:-----------:|
| Least-Significant Bit | PNG         |

## Proposal
Our group members will embed our names into the below PNG image of a stegosaurus. We will create a program that can both embed a message into an image using the imageâ€™s least significant bits and extract a message from the least significant bits of a given image. Our program will also create a random key that indicates which pixels we will be utilizing and require a person attempting to decrypt the message to provide said key.
